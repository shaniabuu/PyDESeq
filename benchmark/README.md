# Benchmarking Methods

In this folder is a copy of the jupyter notebook that includes the script to run DESEq2 on the [RNA-seq reads](https://github.com/shaniabuu/PyDESeq/tree/main/data/lab_data) from mice with chow diet and mice with a high fat diet that was used in lab 4
and the code to generate a volcano plot with the DESeq2 results, as well as the resulting volcano plot. This jupyter notebook was run against our PyDESeq command on the lab 4 data to determine our tool's accuracy.
