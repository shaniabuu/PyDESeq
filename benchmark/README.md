# Benchmarking

In this folder is a copy of the jupyter notebook that includes the script to run DESeq2 on the [RNA-seq reads](https://github.com/shaniabuu/PyDESeq/tree/main/data/lab_data) from mice with a chow diet and mice with a high fat diet that was used in lab 4
and the code to generate a volcano plot with the DESeq2 results. The resulting volcano plot and list of differentially expressed genes, their log2 fold changes, and their p-values are also included in this folder. This jupyter notebook was run against our PyDESeq command on the lab 4 data to determine our tool's accuracy. The output of our PyDESeq tool using the lab 4 data can be found [here](https://github.com/shaniabuu/PyDESeq/tree/main/test/lab_data).
