# Benchmarking

In this folder is a copy of the jupyter notebook that includes the script to run DESEq2 on the [RNA-seq reads](https://github.com/shaniabuu/PyDESeq/tree/main/data/lab_data) from mice with chow diet and mice with a high fat diet that was used in lab 4
and the code to generate a volcano plot with the DESeq2 results, as well as the resulting volcano plot and list of differentially expressed genes. This jupyter notebook was run against our PyDESeq command on the lab 4 data to determine our tool's accuracy. The output of our PyDESeq tool using the lab 4 data can be found [here](https://github.com/shaniabuu/PyDESeq/tree/main/test/lab_data).
