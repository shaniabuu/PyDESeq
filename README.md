# PyDESeq

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to build a tool in Python that calculates the log2 fold change values and p-values from RESM and TPM results to perform differential expression analysis of two datasets, condition vs. control. Additionally, the tool will include the function of generating volcano plots for differential expression with log2 fold change values as the x-axis and the -log10 p-value as the y-axis.
